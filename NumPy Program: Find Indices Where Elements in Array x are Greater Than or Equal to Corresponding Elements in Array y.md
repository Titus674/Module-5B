# # NumPy Program: Find Indices Where Elements in Array x are Greater Than or Equal to Corresponding Elements in Array y

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program using **NumPy** that finds the indices where elements in array `x` are greater than or equal to their corresponding elements in array `y`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. **Import NumPy**: Import the NumPy library.
2. **Define Arrays**: Define two NumPy arrays, `x` and `y`, with the same shape (i.e., same number of elements).
3. **Use Boolean Indexing**: 
   - `x > y` gives a boolean array where elements of `x` are greater than `y`.
   - `x == y` gives a boolean array where elements of `x` are equal to `y`.
4. **Find Indices**: Use `np.where()` to get the indices where the conditions `x >= y` are satisfied.
5. **Print Indices**: Print the indices where the condition holds true.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
import numpy as np
x = np.array([5, 8, 2, 9, 6])
indices = np.where(x >= y)
y = np.array([3, 8, 4, 7, 6])
print("Array x:", x) print("Array y:", y) print("Indices where x >= y:", indices[0])
```
## Output
![439805383-e4b4a900-ec3f-49eb-b501-0dd4f70ccd96](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd51e82a-79df-464f-aee4-eb97ac09eb09)

## Result
Thus the program has been successfully executed.
